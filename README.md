# Where to host?
We recommend you to use <a href="https://fl0.com">fl0.com</a>, <a href="https://back4app.com">back4app.com</a>, <a href="https://koyeb.com">koyeb.com</a> and <a href="https://render.com">render.com</a>. They're free and there you can host Dynamic and other discord bots. More information about other hostings are <a href="https://github.com/DmitryScaletta/free-heroku-alternatives">here</a>

# Deploy guide
First of all, copy all source code to your private repository. Then create an account on railway.app via github. Use Dockerfile for quick deployment. Railway.app is one of the best free hosting provider, where you don't need to add http server to your bot for 100% uptime. 

# Dockerfile example
<pre>
# For deployment on railway.app
FROM golang:latest

WORKDIR /Dynamic

COPY . .

RUN go build Dynamic

CMD [ "./Dynamic" ]
</pre>

<pre>
# For deployment on render.com and others
FROM golang:latest

WORKDIR /Dynamic

COPY . .

RUN go build Dynamic

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "./Dynamic" ]
</pre>

If you want to deploy your fork on render.com, add code snippet bellow to main.go
<pre>
// imports
import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
	"time"

	"github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo"
	"github.com/joho/godotenv"
)

//starts http server
func main() {
	go func() {
		http.HandleFunc("/", getRoot)
		err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	}()

}

func getRoot(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Printf("got / request\n")
	io.WriteString(w, "Dynamic is at render.com now.. ðŸš€\n")
}
</pre>
